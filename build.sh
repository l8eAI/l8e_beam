# This script automates the full build and test process for the l8e-beam package.
# It performs the following steps:
# 1. Downloads the required spaCy models.
# 2. Copies the models into the source directory.
# 3. Runs the unit test suite.
# 4. Cleans up old build artifacts.
# 5. Builds the final .whl and .tar.gz package.
#
# To use it:
# 1. Make sure you are in an activated virtual environment with build tools installed (pip install build).
# 2. Make the script executable: chmod +x build.sh
# 3. Run the script: ./build.sh

# Exit immediately if a command exits with a non-zero status.
