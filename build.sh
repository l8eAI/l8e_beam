# This script automates the setup and testing process for the l8e-beam package.
# It robustly handles spaCy model versions by finding the downloaded model
# and renaming it to the fixed path expected by the Python code.
#
# To use it:
# 1. Make sure you are in an activated virtual environment.
# 2. Make the script executable: chmod +x build.sh
# 3. Run the script: ./build.sh

# Exit immediately if a command exits with a non-zero status.
